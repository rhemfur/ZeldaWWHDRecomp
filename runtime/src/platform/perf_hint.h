// Android performance hints (ADPF): the threads that make each frame tell the system how long a
// frame took against its 33 ms budget, so the CPU governor raises their cores' clocks when the game
// falls behind (without it, a phone left the render thread's prime core at about 1 GHz).
// No-ops elsewhere.
